My name is Jonathan Zhu and I attended New Utrecht High school. Some hobbies that I have is playing video games, create projects, and code.
I am in the trying to go for the dual accelerated program by the end of 2nd year so that I can take BS/MS degrees within 5 years, taking SE/CS.
My goal is to get an intership this summer as a first year so I can learn the algorithms, experience, and work load that I would be doing when I get a job as a software engineer
I have wanted to become a software engineer since I was little and going to RIT is a path to that goal.
